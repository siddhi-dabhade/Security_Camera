# Security_Camera

I'm thrilled to share that I've recently completed my very own security camera project, designed to keep a watchful eye on my surroundings and alert me to any movement detected. Leveraging the powerful capabilities of the cv2 (OpenCV) library in Python, I've created a sophisticated surveillance system that enhances the security of my space.

Using a standard webcam, my security camera continuously captures live video feed. Employing the cv2 library, I've implemented motion detection algorithms that analyze each frame in real-time, allowing the system to detect any significant changes or movements within the camera's field of view.

Upon detecting motion, my security camera springs into action, triggering an alert beep to notify me of the potential intrusion or activity. This immediate notification ensures that I can respond promptly to any security concerns, whether I'm at home or away.
